# Python Lab EC Code Enhancements

1.) I attempted all 3 parts of this EC lab and I successfully completed all 3 parts.
2.) I believe the hardest part of this lab was functionalizing the code as requested in part A. Once I was able to get through that part, I thought that part B was not necessarily hard, but took a long time to debug. Overall, this was one of the most challenging and time consuming labs, but it was exciting to see it finally work!
